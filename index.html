		<h1>Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone</h1>
		<p>

		Inspired by the production infrastructure of Google and others, SPIFFE is a set of
		open-source standards for securely identifying software systems in dynamic and heterogeneous
		environments.

			<p>

			SPIFFE (Secure Production Identity Framework
			For Everyone) provides a secure identity,
			in the form of a specially crafted X.509
			certificate, to every workload in a modern
			production environment. SPIFFE removes the
			need for application-level authentication
			and authorization and complex network-level
			ACL configuration. <a href="{{ "/spiffe/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" role="button">Learn More</a>

			The SPIFFE standards are the result of a number of
			<a href="https://www.cncf.io/">CNCF</a> participants and other
			interested parties coming together to propose a common method for
			services to present and authorize their identities to one another.

			SPIFFE is still in its early implementation
			stages and not yet ready for production
			deployment - you can help out by
			<a href="/community">contributing.</a>
			The work on SPIFFE and SPIRE is being coordinated by
